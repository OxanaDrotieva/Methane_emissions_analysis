# Possible Technologies to be Used


## Data Cleaning and Analysis
Pandas will be used to clean the data and perform an exploratory analysis. Further analysis will be completed using Python. Excel was used in the ETL process for manual manipulation of the data.

## Database Storage
An AWS RDS Database was created and connected to Postgres. An AWS S3 bucket was created for data storage.

## Machine Learning
SciKitLearn is the ML library we'll be using. Plotly and HVPlot will be used to display clusters.

## Dashboard
JavaScript, HTML, and Github pages will be used to create and display the dashboard. Tableau will also be used for further visualizations to be included in the dashboard.
