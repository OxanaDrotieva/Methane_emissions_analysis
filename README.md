# Machine Learning Models

## Questions to Answer
1. Is there a relationship between methane emission and GDP?
2. When GDP is higher, does gas emissions go up, down, or not related?
3. Can previous GDP and Emissions data help predict future methane emissions?


## Potential ML models

Libraries used:
- Scikit-learn
- Plotly
- hvPlot

Unsupervised Clustering Algorithm
- Uncover trends in the data
- Country, GDP, Emissions axis data; filter by year possibly
